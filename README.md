# IL3895_Arduino
This will be an Arduino compatible driver for IL3895 e-paper displays, with basic functionality similar to the Adafruit TFT library.
I'm leaving out common features that I don't plan on using, but if anyone ends up using this library, then I  might add more in the future.

##Planned:
- [ ] Initialize device for 152x152 screen resolution
- [ ] Fill screen
- [ ] Draw pixel, draw line, draw rectangle
- [ ] Display 152x152 monochrome bitmap *(from external ROM if I can't cram what I need onto the AVR)*
- [ ] Draw text starting from given pixel position
